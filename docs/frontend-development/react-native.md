# React-Native

React Native is a framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React.

It allows us to create real native Android and iOS apps using a single codebase.

Think of it as **Write once in JavaScript, run as native mobile apps**

Simple explanation

Traditional mobile development looks like this:

```md
Android App → Java / Kotlin
iOS App → Swift / Objective-C
```

For this we need:

- Two separate codebases

- Two different skill sets

- More time and maintenance

React Native works like this :

```md
React Native App(JavaScript)
↓
Native Android & iOS Components
```

You write JavaScript + React, and React Native converts it into native UI components.

- Not a web app
- Not a hybrid WebView app
- Real native performance
